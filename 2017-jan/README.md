# January 24th, 2017 - Mike Wood with "Being Efficient with Azure Automation"

Individual humans do not scale very well. Let's face it, we can barely multitask. So with Cloud Computing how do we keep up with the growing demand for maintenance tasks for these "infinitely scalable" assets? The answer is automation.

Azure Automation is a highly available automation service which helps you "Automate all the things". Anything from deployments, to monitoring to maintenance tasks can be set up using this reliable workflow execution engine. This presentation covers the fundamentals of the Azure Automation service and provides some insights into how to leverage it with your own solutions.
